# Waste-Image-Classification-CNN

This repository contains a deep learning project focused on classifying waste images into different categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to develop an efficient and generalizable model to automate waste sorting, contributing to better recycling and waste management.

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to design, train, and evaluate CNN models capable of accurately classifying images of various waste types. The aim is to achieve a balanced accuracy and ensure the model generalizes well to new, unseen waste images.

## Files Overview

* **`waste_image_classification.ipynb`**: This Jupyter notebook details the entire machine learning pipeline for waste image classification, including:
    * **Data Preprocessing**: Steps for loading, resizing, normalizing, and preparing image data for CNN training.
    * **Model Architecture**: Construction and training of multiple CNN models with varying numbers of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers.
    * **Model Evaluation**: Assessment of model performance using metrics such as accuracy and loss, demonstrating the effectiveness of different architectures.
    * **Optimization Strategies**: Discussion of challenges (e.g., class imbalance, indistinguishable features) and recommendations for improving model performance in real-world scenarios through techniques like data augmentation, consistency in image quality, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset

This project relies on a dataset of waste images categorized into types such as cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash. **Please note: The raw image dataset is not included in this repository due to its size.** The Jupyter notebook is designed to work with a dataset typically available in environments like Google Colab (e.g., mounted from Google Drive or downloaded from a public source). To run the notebook, you will need to ensure the dataset is accessible at the specified path or modify the notebook to load your own waste image dataset.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow/Keras (for building and training CNN models)
* NumPy (for numerical operations)
* Matplotlib (for data visualization)
* Scikit-learn (for utilities like `train_test_split`)

## Getting Started

To explore or run the analysis:

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries (you can install them via `pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`).
3.  **Provide the Waste Image Dataset**: You will need to obtain the waste image dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or a similar public source) and ensure it is accessible to the notebook (e.g., by uploading it to your Google Drive and mounting it in Colab, or by placing it in an appropriate local directory and updating the notebook's file paths).
4.  Open `waste_image_classification.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, VS Code with Jupyter extension, or Google Colab).
5.  Run the cells sequentially to execute the data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
